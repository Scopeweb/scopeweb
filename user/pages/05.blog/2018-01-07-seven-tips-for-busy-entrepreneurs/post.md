Busy, busy, busy, is how many entrepreneurs feel. They have little time and there is always work to be done. To prevent you from being overloaded by this pressure, time management can offer a solution. You make a good layout of your day that is tailored to your work. With this support you can work efficiently and achieve your goals.

Entrepreneurship is a state of mind that brings many personal and professional traits. Being able to launch, execute, expand and scale a business is an intellectual exercise involving a lot of research, networking, planning, business strategy, marketing, sales and a number of related activities.

As a result, entrepreneurs must jump between tasks, hop on demand, attend events, and be extra careful with each and every decision for their business effort. Managing their time in the right way is an indispensable skill and, in the long run, extremely rewarding.

Burn-out is a critical condition of complete mental and physical exhaustion through stress, often caused by working 80-hour weeks (or more) and seeing little to no progress on your activities. While entrepreneurs are at risk of burning out more often, an interesting study of 200 American employees - full-time and part-time employees, together with independent freelancers and entrepreneurs - revealed a surprising reaction from 50% of the self-employed indication of zero burnout.

Experienced freelancers, entrepreneurs and successful entrepreneurs have mastered a number of time management techniques and strategies that keep their common sense in check and prevent them from causing discrepancies during meetings and the planning process.

## Divide your activities into simple problems
<br>
Try to map out what a normal working day looks like. If necessary, write down what you do in a day. You may be surprised to find that at the end of the day you spend time with coffee, traveling to appointments, calling and e-mailing. Also ask yourself what exactly the work you want to do in a day. It is very annoying to feel that you are not getting anywhere.

Using your consciousness requires more energy and can be prevented by simplifying your problems. Excellence in time management revolves around establishing a process and splitting into small, atomic operations that are easy to understand and do not require intensive resource consumption.

Successful entrepreneurs take a complex task and dissect it into pieces, making the remaining process easier to understand and follow. The simple operations are simple and the execution of these tasks does not require dozens of follow-up questions so you can not check tasks from your list.

## Create a priority system
<br>
The priorities vary for companies and relate to deadlines, the importance of implementation, possible ROI and reach. But we often miss the essence that delivers value in the long term or focus on a single process for weeks by leaving everything else behind.

Time management strategies such as Getting Things Done develop a methodology that is built around creativity, focus and efficient planning. David Allen, the founder of GTD, believes that people first have to learn to monitor and process their required daily tasks in order to concentrate on bigger picture goals.

Learning to prioritize both long-term and later-coming activities and short-term goals needed for incremental results is crucial and requires careful planning by entrepreneurs.

## Start with a simple task
<br>
If you do not complete a broad and complex task over the course of the day, you will be demotivated and you will prevent progress in your weekly planning.

An excellent way to break the ice starts with a trivial and fast task that would give you a head start. This will initiate your productivity mode and pressure and allow you to concentrate on more complex assignments later on.

In addition, it is very important to keep an agenda. This can be done on paper, but also by using [Office 365](https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1) or other alternatives .By keeping abreast of what you have to do, you keep it clear. This way you also prevent you from forgetting important appointments or activities.

Work out your entire week every Sunday for every task you have not planned yet. This way you can start each day by going through the agenda and showing yourself what you want to do at the end of the day. Important when creating a task list is that the tasks are feasible. There must also be room for emergency tracks in between, so keep space for it.

## One thing at a time
<br>
It has become very simple and common nowadays to do two things at once. Call while driving, talk to a colleague and at the same time send an e-mail, lunch during a meeting. It may seem efficient, but all of this haste makes you very stressed. It works better to do one thing at a time, so you have all your attention and make fewer mistakes. Driving a car is also much more relaxed with the radio instead of continuous business conversations.

** Looking for a way to work more efficiently and effectively? Then read the book [Making it all work](https://www.amazon.com/Making-All-Work-Winning-Business/dp/0143116622) by David Allen. **

David Allen is clear about the term "time management": "You can not manage time." You can not work 25 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no matter how hard you try. But you can make the difference in what you do. That is why GTD as a method is strongly focused on how you choose which action. Through an overview of your actions you can choose what you think is most important to do. This can also be an administrative job that does not help you much, but could consist of talking to your colleagues or a walk in the park and also a strategic brainstorm with your team. Taking action and being able to make a choice is the way to win time.

If you are unable to carry out your planning due to ad hoc work or malfunctions, then you have the choice at the time of the malfunction. After all, an overview of what you wanted to do makes it easier to tackle a malfunction and to know what is left behind or motivated not to work with the malfunction, because there are other tasks that first deserve attention.

Time management in the sense of tighter plans and putting the clock at the center has less impact than a strong orientation on actions.

## Create a roadmap for the long term
<br>
One of the repetitive tasks that you can get out of your daily activities is planning. Although it is good to have individual tasks arising from your interactions during the working week, you can use a long-term planning to better concentrate and determine whether your new tasks are in line with your goals.

Review your business plan and set up some KPIs. Assign a few milestones to them and add them to your calendar - with goals per month or quarter, for a period of 1-3 years. Make a list of your repetitive activities (content production, social media appointments, partner calls) in each slot and take it from there.

By defining the familiar tasks that are crucial to your success in the long run, you can determine the expected outcome and measure it once or twice a month. You also get a clearer picture of your weekly availability and stop the excessive use of your buffers by putting too much on your plate.

## Reality Check
<br>
Dealing with different priorities at the same time can be overwhelming and blocks your thinking for weeks and prepares your brain for a burn-out. The core of the problem is often related to a distance to reality and a distraction from business goals.

If you are struggling with your standard workflow, take a step back and adjust your roadmap again. See where you started, where you are at that moment and how your progress is progressing. If everything seems to be on the right track, just continue with the focus on results and remove distractions from your list. Otherwise, you will adjust your schedule differently and you will make more time available so that your indicators can be reached more quickly by the end of the quarter.

## Take regular breaks for brainstorming
<br>
Successful entrepreneurs mainly work 'on' the company and less 'in' the company. When your knees are in your overlapping tasks, you often lose perspective on the purpose.

Take regular breaks between activities and align your progress with your goals. Go out and take a walk, get some fresh air and relax for a moment - this would also bring some creative ideas that you can implement in your work.

## Always improve your strategy
<br>
No matter how efficient your strategy is, there is always room for improvement. For an entrepreneur, learning never stops - whether it's your professional capacity, or business and personal development, time management and a better life. Always keep an eye on tasks that take too long, or that you need to repeat too often, and try to optimize or simplify them.
