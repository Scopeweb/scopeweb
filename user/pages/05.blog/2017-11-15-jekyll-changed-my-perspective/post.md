# Jekyll changed my perspectives!
<br>
How did Jekyll change my life? I want to take the time to summarize my experiences with WordPress prior to Jekyll to compare how effective Jekyll has been over the past year. Although I have "stopped" using WordPress, there is good use for WordPress and I can respect that. I used WordPress for many years as my go-to CMS and created a variety of websites with WordPress, including portfolios, personal websites, blogs. Jekyll came to my attention when I heard about the ease of use and the lightweight option it offered when you want to use GitHub pages for hosting.

## Personal website
<br>
Jekyll was a great experience for me and it served me well for my personal website - [mrdemonwolf.me](https://www.mrdemonwolf.me) - but I hope there will soon be a stronger set of documentation, especially when it comes to to Liquid Templating and the (hidden) powers it offers. These tricks, conceived by one of Scope Web's senior engineers, gave me the opportunity to dynamically create the portfolio items that I wanted to add for my personal website during the build. What I do want to emphasize is that these functions for the dynamic creation of content have really given me a good insight into slightly more advanced templates.

For now I am exploring the possibilities to build more Jekyll projects, such as a blog, because I will continue to work on projects with increasingly larger formats. In any case, it is a very powerful tool to make static (GitHub Pages) websites quite easy and allow simple changes, such as adding new blog entries.

In general, my experience with Jekyll is very positive and it makes building a website very easy.

Of course you lose a lot of dynamic functions, but the point that I do not have to worry about a security problem justifies this decision.

The loading times are also very fast, especially on a shared server. Have you tried to build a GitHub pages website with Jekyll? Let me know your experiences below!
