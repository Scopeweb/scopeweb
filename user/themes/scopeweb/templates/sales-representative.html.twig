                        <h4 class="mb-4">Our values</h4>
                        <h6>Be 20% Wrong</h6>
                        <p>As a startup, speed is extremely important. The quicker we move, the more mistakes we make. If we are making no mistakes, it means, quite simply, that we‚Äôre not moving fast enough. Therefore, a 20% error rate is, not only
                            permissible, but expected. If you‚Äôre not wrong 20% of the time, you‚Äôre not moving fast or ambitious enough.</p>
                        <h6 class="mt-5">Be Fearless</h6>
                        <p>Fear is the primary motivator of human action. It drives people to cherish safety and complacency, coupled with an aversion to risk and change. However, it‚Äôs risk and change that advances the human race. Extreme risk and
                            change is required to disrupt the digital commerce space as we know it. The outside world can‚Äôt possibly have the same knowledge that we have within our company walls. While we‚Äôre being called crazy, we must be fearless
                            and driven by our internal conviction.</p>
                        <h6 class="mt-5">Chase 10X, Not 10%</h6>
                        <p>The only way a startup with 10s of people can outcompete corporations with 1000s is by leveraging its force multipliers of nimbleness, talent, and creativity. Large corporations focus on 10% optimizations to generate millions
                            in revenue. They cannot evoke major changes without years of preparation. As a startup, we don‚Äôt have that luxury‚Ä¶ it also does not make economic sense to optimize something that‚Äôs very small. There are always more
                            incremental features to build. There are always more incremental people to hire. But, from product to people, we must consistently chase 10X opportunities and force multipliers.</p>
                        <h6 class="mt-5">Fuck Yes or No</h6>
                        <p>Fuck Yes or No is the guiding philosophy for our decisions. Starting with why we work at Scope Web, it is, quite simply, because we‚Äôre obsessed. We‚Äôre not here to advance our professional careers or for a financial outcome.
                            We‚Äôre here because we‚Äôre obsessed with changing the world and becoming the best versions of ourselves. And we trust that, to the degree to which we do what we are obsessed with, everything else in life will fall into
                            place. Similarly, we make only ‚ÄúFuck Yes‚Äù decisions about others we bring onto the team and product features we build.</p>
                        <h6 class="mt-5">Keep It Simple</h6>
                        <p>Complexity worship has drowned the modern world. Simple solutions are harder to come to, and, rather than be dismissed as ‚Äútoo simplistic‚Äù, should be hailed as a result of clear thinking. Simplicity enables speed, reduces
                            cost, and allows for faster learning. Win As A Team</p>
                        <p>At Scope Web, we want everyone to be as successful in their pursuits as possible. We know that our peers‚Äô successes are tied to ours. And their triumphs, whether personal, professional, or otherwise, will benefit the company
                            and us as individuals in the long-term.</p>
